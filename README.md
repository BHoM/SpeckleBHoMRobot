# SpeckleBHoMRobot

A Speckle Client for Robot that deals in BHoMObjects.

## Milestones:

- [ ] ~~Create a Winforms Chromium browser to expose Speckle client into, using [CEFSharp](http://cefsharp.github.io/) as done in [SpeckleRhino](https://github.com/BHoM/SpeckleRhinoFork)~~
- [ ] (Currently WIP) Implement SpeckleUi as done in [SpeckleRevitReboot](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleRevitReboot)
- [x] Receive data from Speckle 
- [ ] Send data to Speckle
- [ ] Convert any BHoMObject into RobotOM by using the existing Robot_Engine converts of [`Robot_Toolkit`](https://github.com/BHoM/Robot_Toolkit)
- [ ] Plan out how to get similar behaviour of Robot_Toolkit in terms of Push and Pull. Implementation of such a functionality would be well into the future. 
- [ ] A simple Import is what we can target initially (like BHoM Adapter's `CreateOnly`).
- [ ] (Well into the future) allow for export.


## Registering the Add-in in Robot
((adapted from the Autodesk Instructions))

### Create a `.tlb` file
1. Go to the folder where the add-in `.dll` is generated (e.g. â€¦\SpeckleBHoMRobot\bin\x64\Debug) and run the following command:
```shell
c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\regasm.exe /tlb /codebase SpeckleRobotClient.dll
```
2. Add the created `.tlb` library to the add-in `.dll` file:
   * From the File menu, \Open\File -> open created add-in .dll file
   * Add created `.tlb` library to `.dll` file (right hand mouse click menu). Resource type should be named as TYPELIB.

3. Change TYPELIB sumber to e.g. 1.0 using Properties
4. Save and close

### Register created add-in `.dll` in RSA
1. Open Command Prompt window as Admin
2. Go to the folder where the add-in .dll file is located and register it by commands:
```shell
c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\regasm.exe /tlb /codebase SpeckleRobotClient.dll
```

### Make it available in the RSA pull down menu
1. Start RSA and select any structure type
2. From the Add-ins Menu, start the Add-ins Manager
3. Locate the path for your `.dll` file using the "..." button then press the Add button
